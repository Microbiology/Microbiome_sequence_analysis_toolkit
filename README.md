# The Open Metagenome Toolkit
A collaborative and open source toolkit to facilitate metagenomic analysis.

This toolkit is focused on mobility. Dependencies are minimal so just [download the most recent release](https://github.com/Microbiology/Microbiome_sequence_analysis_toolkit/releases) and you should be good to go.

Suggestions or function requests? Let me know by creating an issue.
